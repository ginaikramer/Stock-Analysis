# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to empoyer clients to automatically calculate total number of shares traded and annual returns for selected stock data in 2017 and 2018. With this data, clients can analyze the results to determine how certains stocks did each year. Additionally, the project involves reviewing and refactoring the code used for automation, to determine if refactoring it makes its execution faster.  If the refactored code runs faster, it can prove beneficial for processing large volumes of stock data. 
### Results
- Stock Performance Between 2017 - 2018
  In order to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, I first had to roll-up the raw stock data for each year. I created a button in the **All Stocks Analysis** tab   of the [VBA Challenge spreadsheet](/VBA_Challenge.xlsm). When this button is clicked would automatically calculate the roll-up, apply the values to the current worksheet and     display positive returns in green and negative ones in red, to make the data more visually appealing and easy to understand.

### Summary
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  - Advantages include:
    - The code is easier for the author and others to read and understand
    - The code is easier to perform troubleshooting to catch issues
    - The code is easier to maintain over time
  - Disadvantages include:
    - The actiion of refactoring can become very time-consuming 
    - Time spent might not be worth the positive gain from refactoring
    - There's a risk of the person refactoring causing bugs in existing code
  
- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- In order to analyze fundraising campaign outcomes by launch date, I created a pivot table to organize and dynamically filter the data.  The pivot table can be viewed in the **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date tab** in the [Kickstarter Challenge Deliverables spreadsheet](/Kickstarter_Challenge_Deliverables.xlsx)
- My observations included:
  - Even though there was data between 2009 and 2017, the majority was within years 2014, 2015 and 2016.
  - The data for 2017 didn't include a full year of data, ending in mid-March 2017.
  - When looking at the data across all years versus the years 2014 through 2016, the outcomes were not significantly different. Therefore, I used all the years of data in my 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 The table can be viewed in the **Outcomes Based on Goals tab** in the [Kickstarter Challenge Deliverables spreadsheet](/Kickstarter_Challenge_Deliverables.xlsx)
  - From the new table, I created a line graph to visualize the percentage of each outcome (successful, failed and canceled) for each goal: ![Play Outcomes by Goal](/Outcomes_vs_Goals_datalabels.png)
